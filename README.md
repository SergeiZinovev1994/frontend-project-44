**Description**:
Brain games is a program that accepts several commands to start mini games (each game contains a greeting at the start). The game waits for you to answer the question it asks. Different games imply different questions. The game will answer whether you answered correctly or not.
"brain-games" : starts the greeting and waits for you to write your name.
"brain-calc" : starts the game "Calculator". You must write the answer to the mathematical expression that the game writes for you.

"brain-even" : starts the game "Check the parity of a number". You must answer 'yes' if the number is even and 'no' if not.
"brain-gcd" : starts the game "Greatest common divisor". You must calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers that the game writes for you.
"brain-prime" : starts the game "Is a number prime?" You must answer 'yes' if the number is prime and 'no' if not.
"brain-progression" : starts the game "Find the missing number". You must find the missing number in arithmetic progression and write it down.
The game goes up to three correct answers. If you answer correctly 3 times, you win. If any answer is incorrect, you lose.
